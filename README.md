Note Taker Assignment

A dynamic appliction to keep track of notes

::INTRO::

This project was a challenge due to its complex folder and filing complexity. I fully understand why everything has a structure and how it contributes to the flexibity and speed of an application. There were times when I had to retrace my steps to find simple errors regarding the filing of certain dependancies that are required in order to function correctly. This was probably the least bit of the more trying portions of this assigment. Although there wasnt much to do by way of styling, there is definitely a place for styling in future projects of this line. The best an worst areas of developing and controlling a database are at play here. Understanding how to create these functions in a way that contribute to each other without prohibiting one another was the most difficult task. The "delete" function turned out to be the challenge that took the most time and effort. Fortunately I had my team (#nedrGang4L) alongside me for this mission. 

::ABOUT::

Creating a dynamic app that holds information in a databse and may be called upon or deleted as neceesary. Intergrating several different dev tools to work as a single functioning entity. Working through multiple languages and applications to reach a desired outcome. #codeNinja

::THE CODE::

Developing the routing aspect of this assignment ended up being 75% percent of the work. Having each portion be able to import and call upon another compartmentalized area while remaining independent of each. That was the insanity and the method by which this goal was accomplished. No portion of this project was developed in SQL but there are aspects that are very similar in concept to the way we create in SQL. For instance, the creation of ID's for each entry and being able to recall an object by using the ID. The ability to store individually and group as a whole. The JS used to control each portion of this app was tedious but once the flow of the system started to form, there wasnt much else to do but follow the breadcrumbs. Making use of dependancies seems to be the norm when working with information. I believe the separation of functions and calling upon them as needed makes for a much easier code to repair, should there be an issue. I will focus more on pseudocoding when wading into this territory. 

::COLLABORATORS::

As usual #nergGang was front and center for the entirety of this project. I found that collectively we are very efficient at task orienting and sourcing out issues and repairing crippled code. I enjoy the interactivity of working with others on projects. Maybe this is because group work is what the career side of developing most resmebles and I look forward to that. Using the tools provided we are able to push through during the COVID pandemic and still create in unison. One of our favorite tools is VS Code Liveshare. This allows us to collectively work on the same file in unison. Sometime there will be 4 cursors moving and coding on one file at the same time. Its like lil nanobots repairing and building a machine. The second most useful tool is Zoom, with slack coming in 3rd. Together with these tools we are able to maintain a semblance of normalcy during these most unusual times.
